Understand how vision-language models \"see\" and \"interpret\" medical images\n2. Craft effective prompts that ground AI analysis in clinical context\n3. Recognize AI hallucinations and apply verification protocols\n4. Evaluate competing AI models using clinical decision criteria\n5. Integrate AI-assisted reads into safe clinical workflows\n\n**Estimated time:** 90-120 minutes"

    "## 0.5. Before We Start: Understanding Medical AI\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you interact with the RadiologyAI engine, you need to understand what you're working with—and more importantly, what its limitations are.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vision-Language Models: The Technology Behind the Assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "The RadiologyAI engine you're about to use is a **vision-language model (VLM)**—an AI system trained to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **\"See\"** patterns in images (like infiltrates, device placement, cardiac silhouettes)\n",
    "2. **\"Understand\"** your clinical questions in natural language  \n",
    "3. **\"Respond\"** with structured text findings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight:** Unlike rule-based systems or clinical decision tools, VLMs use **statistical pattern recognition**. They don't \"know\" medicine in the way a radiologist does—they've learned associations from analyzing millions of images and text pairs during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like this:\n",
    "- A radiologist **understands** that hazy opacities in a certain distribution suggest pulmonary edema because they know cardiac physiology\n",
    "- A VLM has **learned** that images with those visual patterns are often described using words like \"pulmonary edema\" in radiology reports\n",
    "\n",
    "The VLM can be remarkably helpful, but it's pattern-matching, not reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is GGUF? Why Does It Matter in Colab?\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see references to \"GGUF\" throughout this lab. Here's what you need to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GGUF** = A quantized model format that trades some numerical precision for much smaller file sizes\n",
    "- **Full MedGemma model:** ~10GB (won't fit in free Colab's memory)\n",
    "- **GGUF quantized version:** ~4GB (perfect for teaching environments)\n",
    "- **The trade-off:** Slightly less nuanced outputs, but 95% as capable for learning purposes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:** Quantization makes cutting-edge AI accessible for education and prototyping. In production radiology departments, you'd typically use the full-precision model on dedicated GPU servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Three Pillars of Safe AI-Assisted Radiology\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **CRITICAL SAFETY PRINCIPLES**\n",
    "\n",
    "Every AI-generated finding in this lab is **preliminary** and requires:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Verification:** A qualified radiologist must review the source images and confirm or revise AI-suggested findings\n",
    "2. **Clinical Correlation:** AI outputs must be interpreted in the context of patient history, physical exam, labs, and prior imaging\n",
    "3. **Documentation:** Any clinical decision informed by AI must document that AI was used as a decision support tool\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Real Practice:** You would never act on an AI read alone. Think of the AI as a smart intern's draft report—useful for catching things you might have missed, but you always verify their work before signing off.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scope of Practice:** As medical students and junior doctors, you are learning to consume AI outputs critically. Interpreting imaging studies and making diagnostic conclusions remains the domain of qualified radiologists and supervising physicians.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common AI Failure Modes You'll Encounter\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Hallucinations:** The AI confidently reports findings that aren't actually present in the image\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Overconfidence:** Stating definitive diagnoses when findings are subtle or ambiguous  \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Measurement Errors:** Quantifying things (angles, volumes, dimensions) without actual measurement tools\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Context Blindness:** Missing clinically relevant details because the prompt didn't explicitly ask about them\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Rare Finding Struggles:** Performing poorly on uncommon pathologies not well-represented in training data\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll practice detecting these failure modes throughout the lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflection Question (Think Before Moving On)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:** An overnight AI system flags a chest X-ray as \"likely normal\" and deprioritizes it in the reading queue. The next morning, a radiologist reviews it and identifies a small pneumothorax that the AI missed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Who is responsible? What safeguards should be in place?\n",
    "\n",
    "*There's no single right answer, but thinking through this now will make you a better steward of these tools.*\n",

   "source": "### Challenge 3.2: Persona Shifting & Priority Framing\n\n**The Power of Persona:**\n\nWhen you assign a \"persona\" to the AI, you're essentially asking it to emphasize the priorities and vocabulary of that specialty. Different specialists look at the same image through different clinical lenses.\n\n**How Personas Affect AI Output:**\n\n| Persona | Primary Focus | Typical Language | Common Priorities |\n|---------|--------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| **Radiologist** | Anatomical findings, differential diagnoses | \"Opacity,\" \"consolidation,\" \"silhouette sign\" | Comprehensive description, DDx |\n| **Cardiologist** | Cardiac silhouette, pulmonary vasculature | \"Cardiomegaly,\" \"vascular redistribution\" | Heart size, fluid status, device position |\n| **Intensivist** | Life-threatening findings, device placement | \"Emergent,\" \"critical,\" \"requires immediate\" | Pneumothorax, line placement, ARDS |\n| **Pulmonologist** | Parenchymal disease, airways | \"Infiltrate,\" \"bronchiectasis,\" \"hyperinflation\" | Infection, COPD, ILD patterns |\n\n**Clinical Scenario:**\n\nThe cardiology team is now rounding on Jordan. They're less concerned with pneumonia resolution (that's improving) and more focused on:\n- **Cardiac silhouette size** (concerned about cardiomegaly)\n- **Pulmonary vascular markings** (fluid status)\n- **Any signs of heart failure** that might complicate sepsis recovery\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n1. Update the persona to `\"cardiologist\"`\n2. Craft a focus statement that prioritizes cardiac concerns\n3. Ask a question that a cardiologist would care about (not a general radiologist)\n\n**🎯 Success Criteria:**\n\nThe AI report should:\n- ✅ Emphasize cardiac findings over pulmonary details\n- ✅ Use cardiology-specific terminology (CTR, vascular redistribution, etc.)\n- ✅ Comment on findings relevant to heart failure assessment\n- ✅ De-emphasize or briefly mention pneumonia (that's pulmonology's domain)\n\n**💡 Pro Tip:**\n\nThe best clinical prompts match the AI persona to the actual consult question. If cardiology is consulting for \"rule out cardiomegaly,\" use the cardiologist persona and frame the question accordingly."

A model with impressive benchmark scores might still be unsafe if it hallucinates critical findings or uses overconfident language.\n\nUse this clinical evaluation rubric to assess both models:\n\n#### **Clinical Evaluation Rubric**\n\n| Criterion | Weight | What to Assess | Example |\n|-----------|--------|----------------|---------|\n| **🔴 Accuracy** | Critical | Does the model correctly identify findings that ARE present? | Model identifies consolidation visible in RLL |\n| **🔴 Safety** | Critical | Does the model avoid hallucinating findings that AREN'T present? | Model doesn't report ETT when none is visible |\n| **🟡 Specificity** | Important | Does the model use precise anatomical/radiological terminology? | \"RLL consolidation\" vs \"white spot in lung\" |\n| **🟡 Actionability** | Important | Do findings inform clinical decisions? | \"Small effusion, clinical correlation advised\" vs \"Some fluid maybe\" |\n| **🟡 Appropriate Uncertainty** | Important | Does the model say \"unclear\" when image quality limits assessment? | \"Poor inspiration limits evaluation of bases\" |\n| **🟡 Structured Output** | Important | Is the report organized (Findings → Impression → Recommendations)? | Clear sections vs stream of consciousness |\n| **🟢 Formatting** | Nice-to-have | Is the output scannable and easy to read? | Bullet points, clear paragraphs |\n\n**Priority Order:**\n1. **Safety first:** A model that hallucinates less is better than one with prettier formatting\n2. **Clinical utility:** Reports must be actionable for the care team\n3. **Usability:** Structure and formatting enhance (but don't replace) clinical value\n\n---\n\n#### **How to Make Your Deployment Recommendation**\n\nAfter running both models, ask yourself:\n\n**For Safety & Accuracy (Most Important):**\n- Which model made fewer safety-critical errors (missed findings, hallucinations)?\n- Which model was more conservative with uncertainty (appropriately hedged)?\n- If you had to escalate ONE report to the attending, which would it be?\n\n**For Clinical Utility:**\n- Which model provided findings that directly address the clinical question?\n- Which model connected findings to patient context more effectively?\n- Which model's output would save the radiologist the most time?\n\n**For Trust & Transparency:**\n- Which model's outputs were more consistent across different prompts?\n- Which model was easier to \"steer\" with persona and focus adjustments?\n- If an error occurred, which model's mistake would be easier to catch?\n\n**Your Final Recommendation Should State:**\n1. **Which model to deploy** (MedGemma or LLaVA)\n2. **Why** (specific strengths observed)\n3. **What safeguards are required** (human review protocol, specific findings to always verify)\n4. **What limitations remain** (edge cases where neither model is reliable)\n\n---\n\n**Now let's run the benchmark with these criteria in mind.**",

It excels at the 80% of routine cases but needs human expertise for the nuanced 20%.\n\n---\n\n#### **On Prompt Engineering:**\n\n**What You Learned:**\n\n1. **Specificity Matters:**\n   - \"Assess for pulmonary edema\" > \"Look at the chest X-ray\"\n   - The more specific your clinical question, the more focused the AI response\n\n2. **Context Transforms Output:**\n   - Providing patient history changes what the AI considers clinically relevant\n   - The same image analyzed with different context produces different findings\n\n3. **Persona Framing Works:**\n   - Assigning a specialist role (cardiologist vs radiologist) shifts priorities\n   - Match the persona to the actual consult question for best results\n\n4. **Structure Improves Usability:**\n   - Asking for \"Findings → Impression → Recommendations\" produces actionable reports\n   - Open-ended prompts lead to rambling, less useful outputs\n\n**Transferable Skill:** These prompt engineering principles apply to all clinical AI tools, not just radiology.\n\n---\n\n#### **On Safety & Verification:**\n\n**Hallucinations Are Common:**\n- All VLMs occasionally report findings that aren't present\n- Devices, measurements, and temporal comparisons are high-risk areas\n- The more specific/confident the AI sounds, the more skeptical you should be\n\n**Trust, But Verify:**\n- Every AI finding requires correlation with source images\n- Critical findings (pneumothorax, free air, PE) require immediate human review\n- Document that AI was used as a decision support tool, not a diagnostic authority\n\n**Scope of Practice:**\n- As students/junior doctors, you're learning to *consume* AI outputs critically\n- Interpreting studies and making diagnoses remains the radiologist's domain\n- Know when to escalate vs when to trust preliminary AI reads\n\n---\n\n### Reflection Exercise\n\nBefore closing this notebook, take 5 minutes to answer these questions for yourself. You can write your responses in a new markdown cell below, or in your personal notes.\n\n**1. Clinical Judgment:**\n\n*\"Under what circumstances would you trust this AI enough to flag a case as 'likely normal' and deprioritize it in the reading queue? What safeguards would you require?\"*\n\n**2. Workflow Integration:**\n\n*\"Where in the care pathway would AI-assisted reads add the most value at your institution? (Screening? Overnight triage? Teaching files? Quality assurance?)\"*\n\n**3. Ethical Responsibility:**\n\n*\"If an AI-assisted read missed a finding that a radiologist would have caught, who is responsible? How does this affect your comfort level using these tools?\"*\n\n**4. Personal Learning:**\n\n*\"What surprised you most about working with medical AI? What remains concerning or unclear?\"*\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps in Your AI-Augmented Practice\n\n#### **In This Course (Optional Extensions):**\n\n- **Stress-test the models:** Repeat the benchmark with your own de-identified cases or challenging public datasets\n- **Build a prompt library:** Create reusable prompt templates for common clinical scenarios (PE protocol, pneumonia follow-up, post-op chest)\n- **Share your findings:** Present your benchmark results to your learning group or clinical supervisor\n\n#### **In Your Clinical Training:**\n\n- **Seek out AI tools:** Ask your radiology, pathology, and cardiology departments what AI systems they're using\n- **Observe integration:** Watch how attendings incorporate AI into their workflow (Do they review every AI flag? Ignore certain outputs?)\n- **Advocate for transparency:** If AI influences a decision about your patient, make sure it's documented in the chart\n\n#### **Stay Current:**\n\n- **Follow the literature:** Medical AI is evolving rapidly; what's true today may change in 6 months\n- **Attend AI grand rounds:** Many academic centers now host regular sessions on clinical AI\n- **Engage with policy:** Regulatory frameworks for medical AI are being written *now*; your generation will inherit (or revise) them\n\n---\n\n### Final Thought: Stay Curious, Stay Critical\n\nYou now have the foundation to be a **thoughtful consumer and collaborator** with medical AI. You understand:\n\n- How these systems work (pattern recognition, not reasoning)\n- Where they excel (routine cases, rapid triage)\n- Where they fail (hallucinations, rare pathology)\n- How to evaluate them (safety > accuracy > utility)\n\n**The technology will evolve.** Models will get better, faster, and more specialized. But your responsibility to **verify, question, and prioritize patient safety** will not change.\n\nAI is a tool. Like a stethoscope, it's only as good as the clinician wielding it.\n\n**You've earned the right to wield it well. Congratulations on completing Project MedVision.**\n\n---\n\n### Optional: Document Your Work\n\nIf you'd like to save your experiments for future reference:\n\n1. **Download this notebook:** File → Download → Download .ipynb\n2. **Save your logs:** Copy your prompt lab notes and benchmark notes to a personal document\n3. **Capture key examples:** Screenshot particularly good or bad AI outputs for teaching cases\n\nYour future self (or your med school study group) will thank you."
